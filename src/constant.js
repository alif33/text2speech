Young children hailing from underprivileged backgrounds, living in disadvantaged communities - where a lack of money is a real problem - are often inhibited from having a good educational experience.
There are multiple possible reasons for a disadvantaged childs education being affected. Reasons which include but are not exclusive to Being unable to afford home-tuition Being unable to obtain educational materials such as books Being unable to consistently commute to (a good) school With a lack of energy, as a result of inadequate nourishment, being unable to concentrate at school. Over three-quarters of respondents to an NEU survey told us their students had demonstrated fatigue (78%) or poor concentration (75%) in school as a result of poverty." (neu.org.uk)
In particular, young children aged 7-11 ('Key Stage 2', in the UK) are at an age where having a high quality education is most crucial, because, as rileychildrens.org states: "School-age children have replaced magical thinking and prelogical thinking with concrete logical thinking. Children of this age group, whose cognitive abilities to utilize logical thinking are being formed, must (at this age) be developing a foundationally concrete understanding of Key Stage 2 mathematics and science, without the risk of falling behind due to harsh external factors. That's where StudyHome comes in. StudyHome exists to provide a freely accessible and high quality online education, so that no child must be deprived of fundamental knowledge that can help them have a better future. StudyHome places an emphasis on mathematics and science, because they're the subjects that promise to equip children with the knowledge to make practical sense of the world, but also contains a broader range of topics and fun quizzes, to offer every student an enriching experience.`;
